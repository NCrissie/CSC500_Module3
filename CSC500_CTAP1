# First thing's first, we initialize  total_total outside our loop. We want to constantly update this value
# with new adds. We also give it the value of 0 to avoid any bugs. Such as starting the program and just saying no
total_total = 0

# Ask the user if they want to start adding items
choice = input("Would you like to add a food item? (yes/no)")

# As long as the user doesn't say no, the loop keeps going
# Also my first time doing a WHILE loop
while choice != "no":

    # Because the user said yes, we get here. Which is asking for the charge of the food
    if choice == "yes":
        food = float(input('Please enter the charge for your food: $'))

        # Repeat back the input
        print(f'You said your food cost: ${food:.2f}')

        # I'm calculating the sales tax and gratuity within the loop, because the user will have a clean step-by-step
        # with their totals. Instead of calculating the total_total and adding the two charges at the end
        # Honestly I wish some stores would do this, so I know the tax for each item, instead of the bulk tax

        # Calculate sales tax by itself
        sales_tax = food * 0.07

        # Calculate gratuity by itself
        gratuity = food * 0.18

        # The total for the food item is the cost, plus the tip, plus the sales tax
        total = food + sales_tax + gratuity

        # The total is then added to the total_total. But we want to preserve the values before as well
        total_total += total

        # We display the calculations as we go. White-spacing for readability
        print(f'Your sales tax for this item is: ${sales_tax:.2f}')
        print(f'Your gratuity for this item is: ${gratuity:.2f}')
        print()
        print(f'Your total so far is: ${total_total:.2f}')
        print()
    # If the user says anything besides yes or no, we ask them to try again
    else:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.")

    # We ask if there are any additional inputs. I mainly did this to practice my knowledge of loops
    # But also because a calculator wouldn't do much good if it only calculates one item
    choice = input("Would you like to add another item? (yes/no)")

# When the loop exits, print the final total_total
print()
print(f'Your total is: ${total_total:.2f}\n')

# Add a final input so the user can review everything before closing
input('Press Enter to exit')
